## Feature Description

The Webex Contact Center Wrap-up Summary AI feature is part of the AI Assistant capabilities designed to enhance agent productivity and customer experience. This feature automatically generates the conversations summaries based on the interactions between the agent and the customer during a contact center session. It helps agents by summarizing the conversation and recommending next actions, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy in post-call documentation. 

Benefits:

**Reduced agent workload**: By automatically generating wrap-up codes and summarizing conversations, agents spend less time on manual documentation.<br/>
**Improved accuracy**: The AI-generated summaries and codes help ensure consistent and precise post-call records.<br/>
**Enhanced customer satisfaction**: Thorough and accurate wrap-up improves follow-up actions and overall customer experience.<br/>
**Increased agent efficiency**: Integration with other AI capabilities like virtual agent summaries and suggested responses helps agents work more effectively.<br/>
**Recommended next actions**: The feature suggests follow-up steps, guiding agents on what to do after the interaction.<br/>
